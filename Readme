Setup:
Clone the repositery: 
Switch to csh by running: csh

NB: all comands should be run from within the main directory


Step 1 (compile the programs):
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh

The files to run Grape will now be found in /grape-dilepton/build

chmod +x build_hep.sh
This builds hep and tauola (can be slow, but only necessary once)


Step 2 (run Grape):
Change parameters in the grape.cards file
chmod +x run_grape.sh
./run_grape.sh


Step 3 (run tauola):
chmod +x run_tauola.sh
./run_tauola.sh

Output will be printed to terminal, with part-processed files found in grape/build
